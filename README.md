# COP-5611-Operating-Systems-Design-Principles

The server directory contains the raspberry pi files

The client directory contains the file that are running on macOS

I could find a way to represent the work done in term of network (certificates ...)

I have read your comment and agree tha the content is light as I lost a lot of time with the project proposal but I will keep developing this server since I have been learning a lot through it

Thank you so much for this semester, I had an important lack of knowledge concerning OS/C/bash and all lower level language and despite being still behind most of the students in the class I am really happy with how much I learnt through the semester !
